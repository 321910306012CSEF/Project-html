	<h2><u><i class="content"><strong><b>The Great Indian Idiology</b></strong></i></u></h2>
	<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong style="font-size: 30px;">P</strong>eople are different in their own ways. Their <i>culture</i>,<i> their ideologies</i>,<i> color and interests</i>, Many other things make them differ from others.The way people are different ideologies differ too as discussed. But what actually makes these ideologies differ.<em> Climate? History ? or is it the gene?</em>. Well it is a bit more complicated than this. People's ideologies differ with<i>their experiences, their time periods, and their family traits</i>.</p>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
	<p>As we talk about this great difference of ideologies lets get a bit macro and talk how ideologies differ in countries. Countries like <em>America, Australia, Canada and England</em> have seen a great and quite impressive changes in their people and state ideology. People there were <i>conservative, racistic and adament</i> decades ago. As time and consequences passeed on they were forced to be <i>equal, respectful and quite supportive</i>. These changes did not turn up to be in one night but took a lot of time to get into the heads of the people there.</p>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
	<p>But differing from these countries follow few other countries which are being in the process of a change. For instance, say, <em>The middle eastern countries, the African countries</em> who have been facing lot of agitations to get <i>liberal to women rights</i> and <i>encourage more towards modernisation and globalization</i>. These countries however have started to change thier ideologies quite quick reacting to the aggitations. Hope's being building that these countries would actually develop more over in the greater dimensions than they are expected.</p>
	</li>
	<br>
	<li>
	<p>There exists few more countries that have been under the process for a long time and react really slow to the process.<i>India</i>, as a great example to this has just been under the process of transformation about centuries, but has mearly changed. The <em>people and the society of India</em> have been under a great fight since centuries. People fought against <i>women rights, equality and development of new oppurtunities</i>, in contrast the later reacted with harsh new outcomes of the old problems. Fights against <em>women rights turned into fake and paid feminisum</em>, fight against <em>equality produced lame usage of the weak in Politics</em> and the fight for <em>new oppurtunities were named childish and foolish acts by the new arrivals</em>. On the other hand these effects started supressing the aggitators with much <i>cheaper look towards people who look for justice and search of experience in a new intern</i>.</p>
	</li> 
	<br>
	<li>
	<p>As time progressed countries like England and America shreaded their flaws, teh countries in the Middle east and Africa would do it soon as the process forces, but the question comes how long would the countries like India take to change, people out there are still being depressed, still demotivated and hurted by the flaws of the fore fathers.</p>
